"""Works around KivyMD 2.0 behaviour that crashes or slows down real phones.

KivyMD's Material 3 ripple draws every touch through an ``Fbo`` whose shader
is assigned after the ``Fbo`` exists. Qualcomm Adreno drivers (most Xiaomi
and Samsung phones) crash while drawing it, so the app closes on the first
tap: kivymd/KivyMD#1900 and #1508 report the same, and kivy/kivy#8098 fixed
this very pattern in Kivy's own ``BoxShadow``. The emulator's software GPU
draws it fine, which is why CI never saw it.

The app switches the ripple off. Buttons still show the press through their
Material 3 state layer, which draws with plain instructions.

On Android it also switches off mouse hover tracking; see ``disable_hover``.
